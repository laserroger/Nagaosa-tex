\chapter[Review of Quantum Mechanics and Basic Principles of Field Theory]{Review of Quantum Mechanics and \\ Basic Principles of Field Theory}
The content of this chapter is nothing but a review of the most basic principles. Starting with the quantum mechanics of a single-particle system, then the canonical conjugate relations, the relation between symmetries and conservation laws, the description of multi-particles systems using field theory, finally gauge invariance and the gauge field will be introduced, all begin fundamental concepts that built the basis for the whole following discussion. The reader should reconfirm the universality of the quantum mechanical description and get a taste of the efficiency of an analogy.
